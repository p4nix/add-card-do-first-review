# show tooltip
After a card has been added with the Add+Review button - or the shortcut - it will show a small tooltip informing you that the cards have been automatically passed.

It is recommended to leave this option at true, but you can also disable it by setting it to false.


### shortcut
This will set the shortcut. Please note that changing this setting requires you to at least reopen the Add Card dialog to take effect. No need to restart Anki completely though!

Default is Ctrl + Shift + Return. Please note that "Return" is the key you most likely know as Enter.

On macOS, Ctrl will translate to the usual Cmd key.

# time
Time which it should add for the duration of the review. Set to something sensible, like 5 - 10 s.

Please do not use negative values or floats. I do not know nor care what happens.
