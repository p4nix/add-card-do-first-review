# add-card-do-first-review
Small add-on that adds a button to the AddCards dialog for instantly reviewing a card after it has been added.
This is particularly helpful if you write your own cards and are bored by seeing cards you literally just made in the review queue.

The add-on is not officially on AnkiWeb as I am too lazy to test it on multiple versions for now and it's also coded not too well.
